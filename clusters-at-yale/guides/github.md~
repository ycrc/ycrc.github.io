# Version control with Git and GitHub

## What is version control?

Version control is an easy and powerful way to track changes to your work. 
This extends from code to writing documents (if using LaTeX/Tex). 
It produces and saves "tagged" copies of your project so that you don't need to worry about breaking your 
code-base.
This provides a "coding safety net" to let you try new features while retaining the ability to roll-back to a 
working version.

Whether developing large frameworks or simply working on small scripts, version control is an important tool to ensure that your work is never lost. 
We recommend using `git` for its flexibility and versatility and [GitHub](https://github.com) for its power in enabling research and collaboration. [^1]

Here we will cover the basics of version control and how to use `git` and GitHub. 

[^1]: We do not recommend the use of <https://git.yale.edu>, which is an internal-only tool not designed 
for research use.


## What is `git` and how does it work?

Git is a tool that tracks changes to a file (or set of files) through a series of snapshots called "commits" or "revisions". 
These snapshots are stored in "repositories" which contain the history of all the changes to that file. 
This helps prevent repetative naming or `project_final_final2_v3.txt` problems. 
It acts as a record of all the edits, along with the ability to compare the current version to previous commits. 

## How to create a `git` repository

You can create a repository at any time by running the following commands:

```sh
cd /path/to/your/project

# initialize the repository
git init

# add files to be tracked
git add main.py input.txt 

# commit the files to the repository, creating the first snapshot
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
```

This sets up a repository containing a single snapshot of the project's two files.
We can then edit these files and commit the changes into a new snapshot:

```sh

# edit files
echo "changed this file" >> input.txt
$ git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   input.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
Finally, we can stage `input.txt` and then commit the changes:

```sh
# stage changes for commit
git add input.txt
git commit -m "modified input file"

```

## Configuring `git`

It's very helpful to configure your email and username with `git`:

```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@yale.edu"
```
This will then tag your changes with your name and email when collaborating with people on a larger 
project. 

## Working with remote repositories on GitHub

We recommend using an off-site repository like [GitHub](https://github.com) that provides a secure and co-located 
backup of your local repositories. 

### Authentication
As of 2021, GitHub no longer allows password authentication to push and pull repository changes. Instead, an SSH key is used - similar to logging into the cluster via SSH.  To set up SSH authentication to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. You can choose to use your existing SSH key, or generate a new one using the instructions in our [SSH Connection](https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/access/ssh/) documentation.
2. Copy the public key of your SSH keypair to your clipboard.  The public key is typically contained in a file named `<your_key>.pub` - for example, `id_rsa.pub` for the default key filename. Open this file in a text editor and copy its contents.
3. Navigate to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and click your user profile icon in the top right.  Select "**⚙️ Settings**". From the "**Access**" submenu on the left, select "**🔑 SSH and GPG Keys**".
4. Click the "**New SSH Key**" button.
5. Add a recognizable title for your key.
6. Paste the contents of your public key into the "**Key**" box and click the "**Add SSH Key**" button.

You can now proceed to testing the newly added SSH key:

1. If you haven't already, add your SSH key to your system's `ssh-agent` as detailed in our [Advanced SSH Configuration](https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/access/advanced-config/) documentation.
2. In a terminal, run `ssh -T git@github.com`.
3. If prompted, reply "yes" to the key fingerprint warning after verifying that the fingerprint displayed matches one of the [official GitHub key fingerprints](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints).
4. If authentication is successful, you will see the message:  
`Hi USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.`


### Hosting a Repository on GitHub

To start, create a repository on GitHub by going to <https://github.com/new> and providing a name and 
choose either public or private access.

!!! warning "Important: select SSH and not HTTPS"
    A 'gotcha' in the GitHub webpage for creating a new repository is that there are two ways to set up the connection between your local repository and the GitHub-hosted remote repository: SSH and HTTPS. Moreover, GitHub may select HTTPS by default. If you set up your connection this way, your attempts to connect will lead to failed password prompts with an error like `remote: Invalid username or token. Password authentication is not supported for Git operations.`. To avoid this problem, carefully follow the below step!

In the resulting web page, there will be a blue box titled `Quick setup - if you've done this kind of thing before`. In this box, click on `SSH` in the 'HTTPS|SSH' selection widget to ensure that your GitHub SSH connection is set up properly.

Then you can connect your local repository to the GitHub repo (named `my_new_repo`):

```sh
git remote add origin git@github.com:user_name/my_new_repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

Alternatively, a repository can be created on GitHub and then cloned to your local machine:
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:user_name/my_new_repo.git
Cloning into 'my_new_repo'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.

```
This creates a new directory (`my_new_repo`) where you can place all your code.


After making any changes and commiting them to the local repository, you can "push" them to a remote repository:

```sh
# commit to local repository
git commit -m "new changes"

# push commits to remote repository on GitHub
git push

```

## Educational GitHub

All students and research staff are able to request free Educational discounts from GitHub. 
This provides a "Pro" account for free, including unlimited private repositories. 

To get started, create a free GitHub account with your Yale email address. 
Then go to <https://education.github.com> and request the educational discount. 
It normally takes less than 24 hours for them to grant the discount.

Educational discounts are also available for teams and collaborations. 
This is perfect for a research group or collaboration and can include non-Yale affiliated people.
