# YCGA Sequence Data Archive

## Retrieve Data from the Archive

In the sequencing archive on [McCleary](/clusters/ruddle), a directory exists for each run, holding one or more tar files. There is a main tar file, plus a tar file for each project directory. Most users only need the project tar file corresponding to their data.

Although the archive actually exists on tape or in cloud storage, you can treat it as a regular directory tree. Many operations such as `ls`, `cd`, etc. are very fast, since directory structures and file metadata are on a disk cache. However, when you actually read the contents of files the file is retrieved and read into a disk cache.  This can take some time.

Archived runs are stored in the following locations.

| Original location                           | Archive location                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/panfs/sequencers`                         | `/SAY/archive/YCGA-729009-YCGA-A2/archive/panfs/sequencers`                         |
| `/ycga-ba/ba_sequencers`                    | `/SAY/archive/YCGA-729009-YCGA-A2/archive/ycga-ba/ba_sequencers`                    |
| `/gpfs/ycga/sequencers/illumina/sequencers` | `/SAY/archive/YCGA-729009-YCGA-A2/archive/ycga-gpfs/sequencers/illumina/sequencers` |

You can directly copy or untar the project tarfile into a scratch directory.

!!! info
Very large tar files over 500GB, sometimes fail to download.  If you run into problems, contact us at hpc@yale.edu and we can
manually download it.


``` bash
cd ~/scratch60/somedir
tar –xvf /SAY/archive/YCGA-729009-YCGA-A2/archive/path/to/file.tar
```

Inside the project tar files are the fastq files, which have been compressed using `quip`. If your pipeline cannot read quip files directly, you will need to uncompress them before using them.

``` bash
module load Quip
quip –d M20_ACAGTG_L008_R1_009.fastq.qp
```

For your convenience, we have a tool, `restore`, that will download a tar file, untar it, and uncompress all quip files.

``` bash
module load ycga-public
restore –t /SAY/archive/YCGA-729009-YCGA/archive/path/to/file.tar
```

If you have trouble locating your files, you can use the utility `locateRun`, using any substring of the original run name. `locateRun` is in the same module as restore.

``` bash
locateRun C9374AN
```

Restore spends most of the time running quip. You can parallelize and thereby speed up that process using the `-n` flag.

``` bash
restore –n 20 ...
```

!!! tip
    When retrieving data, run untar/unquip as a job on a compute node, **not a login node** and make sure to allocate sufficient resources to your job, e.g. `–c 20 --mem=100G`.

!!! tip
    The ycgaFastq tool can also be used to recover archived data.  See [here](/clusters/ruddle/#access-sequencing-data). 

## Example:
Imagine that user rdb9 wants to restore data from run BHJWZZBCX3

### step 1
Initialize compute node with 20 cores
``` bash 
salloc -c 20
module load ycga-public
```

### step 2
Find the run location
``` bash
$ locateRun BHJWZZBCX3
/ycga-gpfs/sequencers/illumina/sequencerV/runs/210305_D00306_1337_BHJWZZBCX3.deleted
/SAY/archive/YCGA-729009-YCGA-A2/archive/ycga-gpfs/sequencers/illumina/sequencerV/runs/210305_D00306_1337_BHJWZZBCX3
```

Note that the original run location has been deleted, but the archive location is listed.

### step 3
List the contents of the archived run, and locate the desired project tarball:
``` bash
$ ls -1 /SAY/archive/YCGA-729009-YCGA-A2/archive/ycga-gpfs/sequencers/illumina/sequencerV/runs/210305_D00306_1337_BHJWZZBCX3
210305_D00306_1337_BHJWZZBCX3_0.tar
210305_D00306_1337_BHJWZZBCX3_0_Unaligned_Project_Jdm222.tar
210305_D00306_1337_BHJWZZBCX3_1_Unaligned-1_Project_Rdb9.tar
210305_D00306_1337_BHJWZZBCX3_2021_05_09_04:00:36_archive.log
```

We want 210305_D00306_1337_BHJWZZBCX3_1_Unaligned-1_Project_Rdb9.tar, matching our netid.

### step 4
Use the restore utility to copy and uncompress the fastq files from the tar file.  By default, restore will start 20 threads, which matches our srun above.  The restore will likely take several minutes. To see progress, you can use the -v flag.
``` bash
restore -v -t /SAY/archive/YCGA-729009-YCGA-A2/archive/ycga-gpfs/sequencers/illumina/sequencerV/runs/210305_D00306_1337_BHJWZZBCX3/210305_D00306_1337_BHJWKHBCX3_1_Unaligned-1_Project_Rdb9.tar
```

The restored fastq files will written to a directory like this: 
``` bash 
210305_D00306_1337_BHJWZZBCX3/Data/Intensities/BaseCalls/Unaligned*/Project_*
```
