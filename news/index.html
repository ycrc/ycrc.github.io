<h3 id="announcements">Announcements</h3>
<h4 id="announcing-hopper-the-new-ycrc-secure-hpc-cluster">Announcing Hopper, the new YCRC Secure HPC Cluster</h4>
<p>We are thrilled to announce the availability of the Hopper HPC cluster. Hopper is a NIST 800-171/HIPAA compliant secure computing environment for all researchers at Yale University for high performance computation of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), NIH Controlled-Access Data, Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and other types of sensitive data. </p>
<p>More information about Hopper can be found at <a href="https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters/hopper/">https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters/hopper/</a>.</p>
<p>Email us at <a href="mailto:research.computing@yale.edu">research.computing@yale.edu</a> to inquire about using Hopper.</p>
<h4 id="beta-testing-complete-for-h200-gpus-on-bouchet">Beta Testing Complete for H200 GPUs on Bouchet</h4>
<p>The beta testing of the H200 GPUs on the Bouchet cluster is now complete and the cluster is available to all Yale researchers for projects with low-risk data. Similar to Grace and McCleary, compute resources are available to all researchers at no cost. If you have used Grace or McCleary since July 1, 2024, we have automatically created an account for you on Bouchet. If you have uploaded ssh keys to Grace or McCleary, your key will already be installed on Bouchet. If you are unsure if you have an account, please try logging into <a href="https://ood-bouchet.ycrc.yale.edu">Bouchet’s Open OnDemand web portal</a> (Yale VPN required) before submitting an account request.
If an account was not automatically created for you on Bouchet, please <a href="https://research.computing.yale.edu/account-request">submit an account request</a>.</p>
<p>Bouchet follows most of the same paradigms as Grace and McCleary, but there are a <a href="/clusters/bouchet_getting_started/">small number of key differences</a>. We encourage you to review those differences before starting work on Bouchet. If you are new to the YCRC clusters, we recommend getting started with <a href="https://research.computing.yale.edu/intro-to-hpc">our Intro to HPC training video</a>.</p>
<h4 id="expanded-office-hours-now-available">Expanded Office Hours Now Available</h4>
<p>We're excited to announce that we've expanded our Office Hours to make it even easier for you to get the research computing support you need! Join us for drop-in consultations on Wednesdays 11am-12pm and our <strong>new</strong> Thursday 2-3pm slot <a href="https://yale.zoom.us/my/ycrcsupport">via Zoom</a> - no appointment needed. </p>
<p>Please check the OHs schedule at <a href="https://research.computing.yale.edu/training-events">https://research.computing.yale.edu/training-events</a> for any changes.</p>
<p>Our Research Support team is here to help you navigate YCRC computing resources, evaluate your project's computational needs, and optimize your workflows from basic setup to advanced applications. Office Hours are perfect for quick consultations (approximately 15 minutes) on general YCRC questions, novice user support, resource monitoring, and troubleshooting common issues like missing libraries. For more complex needs such as custom software installations, detailed code troubleshooting, or miniconda environment setup, we encourage you to contact us at research.computing@yale.edu to schedule a dedicated 1-on-1 consultation where we can provide the focused attention your project deserves. </p>
<p>Whether you're just getting started or working with exceptional computational requirements, we're here to collaborate with you and ensure you're making the most of Yale's research computing resources.</p>
<p>Learn more about the computational research support services our team provides at https://research.computing.yale.edu/research-support/services and <a href="/#get-help">contact us</a> with any questions. </p>
<h4 id="new-ycrc-website">New YCRC Website</h4>
<p>In early August, we launched our new website--<a href="https://research.computing.yale.edu">research.computing.yale.edu</a>, which was built on the new Yale Sites platform. We hope the new site will prove to be user friendly and informative. Please share any feedback and suggestions for improvement by <a href="https://research.computing.yale.edu/contact-web-editor">contacting the web editor</a>.</p>

<h4 id="ai-initiative-gpus-now-available">AI Initiative GPUs Now Available</h4>
<p>Following the <a href="https://provost.yale.edu/yale-task-force-artificial-intelligence">AI Task Force's recommendation</a> that the university invest in high-end GPUs over the next several years, we are thrilled to announce the first set of GPUs funded by the <a href="https://provost.yale.edu/news/advancing-yales-leadership-artificial-intelligence-support-faculty-students-and-staff">Provost’s AI Initiative</a> are now available on the YCRC clusters.</p>
<ul>
<li>80 H200 NVIDIA GPUs on Bouchet (for research without sensitive data).</li>
<li>32 H200 NVIDIA GPUs on Hopper (for research requiring NIST 800-171, HIPAA, or other sensitive data)</li>
<li>12 H100 NVIDIA GPUs on Milgram (for research with unregulated sensitive data)</li>
</ul>
<p>Please <a href="/#get-help">contact us</a> with questions and for assistance. </p>
<h4 id="priority-tier-fast-lane-available">Priority Tier “Fast-Lane” Available</h4>
<p>On December 1st, 2024, we introduced Priority Tier partitions on Bouchet, Grace, McCleary and Milgram. Jobs submitted to a Priority Tier partition precede all pending jobs in the corresponding standard tier partitions in the scheduling queue to provide a “fast-lane”. The Priority Tier partitions are also composed of the YCRC’s newest nodes and GPUs, ensuring priority jobs run on our fastest and most powerful resources. If you are interested in using Priority Tier, you can learn more and request access on <a href="https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/job-scheduling/priority-tier/">our Priority Tier docs page</a>.</p>
<h4 id="research-support-at-pearc25">Research Support at PEARC25</h4>
<p>During the week of July 20th, the YCRC Research Support team attended the <a href="https://pearc.acm.org/pearc25/">annual PEARC conference</a>, a conference specifically focused on the research computing community. The team had the opportunity to meet with many of our peer institutions to discuss our common challenges and opportunities and attend sessions to learn about new solutions. We look forward to incorporating new ideas and solutions from PEARC to the YCRC’s offerings this year!</p>

<h4 id="bouchet-open-to-all-yale-researchers">Bouchet Open to All Yale Researchers</h4>
<p>The Bouchet HPC cluster is now available for all Yale researchers. Bouchet contains approximately 10,000 direct-liquid-cooled cores as well as 48 NVIDIA A5000Ada GPUs. 80 NVIDIA H200 GPUs will be added to Bouchet in early July. Accounts on Bouchet can be requested now via the <a href="https://research.computing.yale.edu/account-request">YCRC Account Request Form</a>. For more information and updates visit the <a href="/clusters/bouchet/">Bouchet Documentation page</a>. Information sessions on transitioning from Grace and McCleary to Bouchet will be held later this summer. Dates will be announced soon! </p>
<h4 id="new-ycga-sequence-data-archive-enhanced-access-to-your-files">New YCGA Sequence Data Archive - Enhanced Access to Your Files</h4>
<p>We’ve launched the new YCGA sequence data archive with a user-friendly web interface to enable simplified retrieval of the archived sequence files. This is a replacement for the existing methods using the ycgaFastq and URLFetch scripts. The new system offers improved performance, reliability, and security, including required CAS login and research group access restrictions.  All of the data in the previous sequence archive has been migrated to the new archive.
For more information and instructions on how to retrieve your files,visit <a href="https://archive.ycga.yale.edu/">https://archive.ycga.yale.edu/</a> (You must be on Yale network and log in via CAS to access) and <a href="/data/ycga-data/">https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/data/ycga-data/</a> If you need assistance, please <a href="/#get-help">contact us</a> for assistance. </p>
<h4 id="troubleshooting-open-ondemand-issues">Troubleshooting Open OnDemand Issues</h4>
<p>If you are experiencing problems with Open OnDemand, such as inability to access the portal or  failures when launching apps, we suggest trying the following solutions to improve performance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check your storage space.</strong> Open OnDemand won't launch if your home directory is full. Verify you haven't exceeded your user quota.</li>
<li><strong>Clear your browser cache completely.</strong> Use a private browsing window or clear your entire browser cache (not just the last 24 hours). This resolves most session-related issues.</li>
<li><strong>For unresponsive RStudio sessions:</strong> If RStudio becomes slow or stops responding, terminate the session and run this command at the shell prompt:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>ycrc_clean_rstudio.sh
</code></pre></div>
<p>This removes temporary RStudio files and allows a fresh start.</p>
<p>Need more help? Additional troubleshooting steps are available in <a href="/access/ood/">our R documentation</a>.

<h4 id="faster-startups-for-modules-and-cluster-apps-including-rstudio-r-and-relion">Faster startups for modules and cluster apps including RStudio, R and RELION</h4>
<p>We've introduced a new "fast module loading" feature that significantly reduces wait times when loading software modules on our McCleary and Grace clusters.</p>
<p>What You'll Notice
- The <a href="https://ood-mccleary.ycrc.yale.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/ycrc_rstudio_server/session_contexts/new">RStudio OpenOnDemand app</a> now launches in about 10 seconds (down from 40 seconds previously), thanks to this optimization running automatically in the background.
- From the command line, load times of large and complex <a href="/applications/modules">modules</a> like R and RELION can be reduced to a few seconds by loading the new <a href="/modules/#fast-module-loading">‘mlq’</a> module and using ‘ml’ to load these modules, i.e.: 'module load mlq; ml R’ instead of ‘module load R’
- If you encounter any problems with fast module loading in our RStudio app, it can be disabled with a new checkbox that appears at the top of the web form.  We developed this tool in house and continue testing and refining it.</p>

<p>Effective December 1st 2024, the current YCRC CPU-Hour based service charges have been replaced with new Priority Tier service charges. The YCRC has added a new Priority Tier of partitions that is an opt-in, fast lane for computational jobs. All computation on the “standard” tier of partitions (e.g. day, week, mpi, gpu) no longer incur charges. Private nodes and scavenge partitions continue to not incur charges. Visit <a href="https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/job-scheduling/priority-tier/">Priority Tier documentation</a> for more information and to request access. The new compute charging model was developed in close collaboration with faculty, YCRC staff, and university administrators to ensure the YCRC service charging models support the researchers relying on our systems as well as the needs of the University.</p>

<h4 id="bouchet-beta-testing-for-tightly-coupled-parallel-workflows">Bouchet Beta Testing for Tightly Coupled Parallel Workflows</h4>
<p>The YCRC’s first installation at Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center will be the HPC cluster Bouchet*.</p>
<p>The first installation of nodes, approximately 4,000 direct-liquid-cooled cores, will be dedicated to tightly coupled parallel workflows, such as those run in the “mpi” partition on the Grace cluster.</p>
<p>We would like to invite you to participate in Bouchet beta testing. We are seeking tightly coupled, parallel workloads only to participate in this phase of development. If you have a suitable parallel workload and would like to participate in testing, please complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjJYSkpyu-UqGH09Tgp2HS3xQ0NFjLOdg6_pRAMDKr4uiU0w/viewform?usp=send_form">Bouchet Beta Request Form</a> and we will contact you with additional information about accessing and using Bouchet.</p>
<p>Following the beta testing (early 2025), we will be acquiring and installing thousands of general purpose compute cores as well as GPU-enabled compute nodes. At that time Bouchet will become available to all Yale researchers for computational work involving low-risk data. Stay tuned for more information on availability of the cluster. </p>
<p>*The cluster named after Edward Bouchet (1852-1918) who earned a PhD in physics at Yale University in 1876, making him the first self-identified African American to earn a doctorate from an American university. </p>

<h4 id="jobstats-on-the-web">Jobstats on the Web</h4>
<p>In our quest to provide detailed information about job performance and efficiency, we have recently enhanced the web-based jobstats portal to show summary statistics and plots of CPU, Memory, GPU, and GPU memory usage over time. </p>
<p>These plots are helpful diagnostics for understanding why jobs fail or how to more efficiently request resources. These plots and statistics are available for in-progress jobs, a great way to keep track of performance while jobs are still running. This tool is part of the User Portal which can be accessed via Open OnDemand for each cluster:</p>

<h4 id="clarity-access">Clarity Access</h4>
<p>Yale is launching the <a href="https://ai.yale.edu/yales-ai-tools-and-resources/clarity-platform">Clarity platform</a>. In its initial phase, Clarity offers an AI chatbot powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o. Importantly, Clarity provides a “walled-off” environment; its use is limited to Yale faculty, students, and staff, and information entered into its chatbot is not saved or used to train external AI models. Clarity is appropriate for use with all data types, including [high-risk data](https://your.yale.edu/policies-procedures/policies/1604-data-classification-policy, provided that <a href="https://cybersecurity.yale.edu/mss">all security standards</a> are observed. Its chatbot is capable of content creation, coding assistance, data and image analysis, text-to-speech, and more. Over time, the platform may expand to incorporate additional AI tools, including other <a href="https://ai.yale.edu/guidance/learn-about-ai#keyterms">large language models</a>. Clarity is designed to evolve as generative AI develops and the community offers feedback. </p>
<p><em>Before using the Clarity AI chatbot, please review <a href="https://ai.yale.edu/yales-ai-tools-and-resources/clarity-platform#training">training resources</a> and <a href="https://ai.yale.edu/yales-ai-tools-and-resources/clarity-platform/clarity-platform-faqs">guidance</a> on appropriate use.</em></p>

<h4 id="yale-joins-mghpcc">Yale Joins MGHPCC</h4>
<p>We are excited to share that Yale University has recently become a member of the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC), a not-for-profit data center designed for computationally-intensive research. The construction of a dedicated space for Yale within the facility and the installation of high-speed networking between Yale's campus and MGHPCC are currently underway. The first High-Performance Computing (HPC) hardware installations are expected to take place later this year. As more information becomes available, we will keep our users updated</p>
<h4 id="oneit-conference">OneIT Conference</h4>
<p>Earlier this year Yale ITS hosted the first in-person One IT conference, [“Advancing Collaborations: One IT as a Catalyst”](https://your.yale.edu/news/2024/04/conference-edition-capturing-spirit-one-it. IT and IT-adjacent personnel from across campus came together to discuss topics that impact research and university operations. YCRC team members participated in a variety of sessions ranging from Research Storage and Software to the role of AI in higher education. </p>
<p>Additionally, YCRC team members presented two posters. The first, [A Graphical Interface for Research and Education](https://image.s10.sfmc-content.com/lib/fe4515707564047b751572/m/1/83cc1a22-d9d3-498d-8a17-8088de496674.pdf, highlighted Open OnDemand and its barrier-reducing impact on courses and research alike. The second, [Globus: a platform for secure, efficient file transfer](https://image.s10.sfmc-content.com/lib/fe4515707564047b751572/m/1/52559eed-25ab-49c9-80be-6ce99fb95b25.pdf, demonstrated our successful deployment of Globus to improve data management and cross-institutional sharing of research materials. </p>

<h4 id="new-grace-nodes">New Grace Nodes</h4>
<p>We are pleased to announce the addition of 84 new direct-liquid-cooled compute nodes to the commons partitions (day and week) on Grace.  These new nodes are of the Intel Icelake generation and have 48 cores each. These nodes also have increased RAM compared to other nodes on Grace, with 10GB per core. The day partition is now close to 11,000 cores and the week partition is now entirely composed of these nodes. A significant number of purchased nodes of similar design have also been added to respective private partitions and are available to all users via the scavenge partition.</p>
<h4 id="limited-mccleary-maintenance-april-2nd">Limited McCleary Maintenance - April 2nd</h4>
<p>Due to the limited updates needed on McCleary at this time, the upcoming April maintenance will not be a full 3-day downtime, but rather a one-day maintenance with limited disruption.  The McCleary cluster and storage will remain online and available throughout the maintenance period and there will be no disruption to running or pending batch jobs.  However, certain services will be unavailable for short periods throughout the day.  See maintenance announcement email for full details.</p>
<h4 id="cluster-node-status-in-open-ondemand">Cluster Node Status in Open OnDemand</h4>
<p>A Cluster Node Status app is now available in the Open OnDemand web portal on all clusters. This new app presents information about CPU, GPU and memory utilization for each compute node with the cluster. The app can be found under ‘Utilities’ -&gt; ‘Cluster Node Status’. </p>
<h4 id="retirement-of-grace-rhel7-apps-tree">Retirement of Grace RHEL7 Apps Tree</h4>
<p>As part of our routine deprecation of older software, we removed Grace's old application tree (from before the RedHat 8 upgrade) from the default Standard Environment on March 6th. After March 6th, the older module tree will no longer appear when <code>module avail</code> is run and will fail to load. If you have concerns about missing software, please contact us at hpc@yale.edu.</p>

<h4 id="cpu-usage-reporting-with-getusage">CPU Usage Reporting with <code>getusage</code></h4>
<p>Researchers frequently wish to get a breakdown of their groups' cluster-usage. While Slurm provides tooling for querying the database, it is not particularly user-friendly. We have developed a tool, <code>getusage</code>, which allows researchers to quickly get insight into their groups’ usage, broken down by date and user, including a monthly summary report. Please try this tool and let us know if there are any enhancement requests or ideas.   </p>
<h4 id="changes-to-rstudio-on-the-web-portal">Changes to RStudio on the Web Portal</h4>
<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> (VSCode) is a popular development tool that is widely used by our researchers. While there are several extensions that allow users to connect to remote servers over SSH, these are imperfect and often drops connection. Additionally, these remote sessions connect to the clusters' login nodes, where resources are limited. </p>
<p>To meet the growing demand for this particular development tool, we have deployed an application for Open OnDemand that launches VS Code Server directly on a compute node which can then be accessed via web-browser. This OOD application is called <code>code_server</code> and is available on all clusters. For more information see [our OOD docs page](https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/access/ood/.</p>

<h3 id="upgrade-to-red-hat-8">Upgrade to Red Hat 8</h3>
<p>As part of this maintenance, the operating system on Milgram has been upgraded to Red Hat 8.</p>
<p>Jobs submitted prior to maintenance that were held and now released will run under RHEL8 (instead of RHEL7).  This may cause some jobs to not run properly, so we encourage you to check on your job output.  Our <a href="/clusters/milgram_rhel8/">docs page</a> provides information on the RHEL8 upgrade, including fixes for common problems.  Please notify hpc@yale.edu if you require assistance. </p>
<h3 id="changes-to-interactive-partitions-and-jobs">Changes to Interactive Partitions and Jobs</h3>
<p>We have made the following changes to interactive jobs during the maintenance.  </p>
<p>The 'interactive' and 'psych_interactive` partitions have been renamed to 'devel' and 'psych_devel', respectively, to bring Milgram in alignment with the other clusters.  This change was made on other clusters in recognition that interactive-style jobs (such as OnDemand and 'salloc' jobs) are commonly run outside of the 'interactive' partition.  Please adjust your workflows accordingly after the maintenance.</p>
<p>Additionally, all users are limited to 4 interactive app instances (of any type) at one time.  Additional instances will be rejected until you delete older open instances.  For OnDemand jobs, closing the window does not terminate the interactive app job.  To terminate the job, click the "Delete" button in your "My Interactive Apps" page in the web portal.</p>
<p>Please visit the status page at <a href="http://research.computing.yale.edu/system-status">research.computing.yale.edu/system-status</a> for the latest updates.  If you have questions, comments, or concerns, please contact us at hpc@yale.edu.</p>

<p>As Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 approaches its end of life, we will be upgrading the Milgram cluster from RHEL7 to RHEL8 during the February maintenance window.  This will bring Milgram in line with our other clusters and provide a number of key benefits:
continued security patches and support beyond 2024,
updated system libraries to better support modern software,
improved node management system</p>
<p>We have set aside rhel8_devel and rhel8_day partitions for use in debugging and testing of workflows before the February maintenance. For more information on testing your workflows <a href="https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters/milgram_rhel8/">see our explainer</a>.</p>

<h3 id="transfer-node-host-key-change">Transfer Node Host Key Change</h3>
<p>The ssh host key for Grace's transfer node was changed during the maintenance, which will result in a "WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!" error when you attempt to login. To access the cluster again, first remove the old host keys with the following command (if accessing the cluster via command line):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>ssh-keygen -R transfer-grace.ycrc.yale.edu
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you are using a GUI, such as MobaXterm, you will need to manually edit your known host file and remove the list related to Grace.
For MobaXterm, this file is located (by default) in <code>Documents/MobaXterm/home/.ssh</code>.</p>
<p>Then attempt a new login and accept the new host key.</p>

<p>In addition to the general purpose scavenge partition, we also have two resource specific scavenge partitions, <code>scavenge_gpu</code> (Grace, McCleary) and <code>scavenge_mpi</code> (Grace only). The <code>scavenge_gpu</code> partition contains all GPU enabled nodes, commons and privately owned. Similarly, the <code>scavenge_mpi</code> partition contains all nodes similar to the <code>mpi</code> partition. Both partitions have higher priority for their respective nodes than normal scavenge (meaning jobs submitted to <code>scavenge_gpu</code> or <code>scavenge_mpi</code> will preempt normal scavenge jobs). All scavenge partitions are exempt from CPU charges.</p>

<h4 id="mccleary-maintenance">McCleary Maintenance</h4>
<p>The biannual scheduled maintenance for the McCleary cluster will be occurring Oct 3-5. During this time, the cluster will be unavailable. See the McCleary maintenance email announcements for more details.</p>
<h4 id="interactive-jobs-on-day-on-mccleary">Interactive jobs on <code>day</code> on McCleary</h4>
<p>Interactive jobs are now allowed to be run on the <code>day</code> partition on McCleary. Note you are still limited to 4 interactive-style jobs of any kind (salloc or OpenOnDemand) at one time. Additional instances will be rejected until you delete older open instances. For OnDemand jobs, closing the window does not terminate the interactive app job. To terminate the job, click the "Delete" button in your "My Interactive Apps" page in the web portal.</p>
<h4 id="papermill-for-jupyter-command-line-execution">"Papermill" for Jupyter Command-Line Execution</h4>
<p>Many scientific workflows start as interactive Jupyter notebooks, and our Open OnDemand portal has dramatically simplified deploying these notebooks on cluster resources.  However, the step from running notebooks interactively to running jobs as a batch script can be challenging and is often a barrier to migrating to using <code>sbatch</code> to run workflows non-interactively. </p>
<p>To help solve this problem, there are a handful of utilities that can execute a notebook as if you were manually hitting "shift-Enter" for each cell. Of note is <a href="https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Papermill</a> which provides a powerful set of tools to bridge between interactive and batch-mode computing.</p>
<p>To get started, install papermill into your Conda environments:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>module load miniconda
conda install papermill
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then you can simply evaluate a notebook, preserving figures and output inside the notebook, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>papermill /path/to/notebook.ipynb
</code></pre></div>
<p>This can be run inside a batch job that might look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p day
#SBATCH -c 1
#SBATCH -t 6:00:00

module unload miniconda
conda activate my_env
papermill /path/to/notebook.ipynb
</code></pre></div>
<p>Variables can also be parameterized and passed in as command-line options so that you can run multiple copies simultaneously with different input variables. For more information see the [Papermill docs pages](https://papermill.readthedocs.io/.</p>

<h4 id="grace-rhel8-upgrade">Grace RHEL8 Upgrade</h4>
<p>As Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 approaches its end of life, we upgraded the Grace cluster from RHEL7 to RHEL8 during the August maintenance window.  This brings Grace in line with McCleary and provide a number of key benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>continued security patches and support beyond 2023</li>
<li>updated system libraries to better support modern software</li>
<li>improved node management system to facilitate the growing number of nodes on Grace</li>
<li>shared application tree between McCleary and Grace, which brings software parity between clusters</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a small number of compute nodes in the <code>legacy</code> partition with the old RHEL7 operating system installed for workloads that still need to be migrated. We expect to retire this partition during the Grace December 2023 maintenance. Please contact us if you need help upgrading to RHEL8 in the coming months.</p>
<h4 id="grace-old-software-deprecation">Grace Old Software Deprecation</h4>
<p>The RHEL7 application module tree (<code>/gpfs/loomis/apps/avx</code>) is now deprecated and will be removed from the default module environment during the Grace December maintenance. The software will still be available on Grace, but YCRC will no longer provide support for those old packages after December. If you are using a software package in that tree that is not yet installed into the new shared module tree, please let us know as soon as possible so we can help avoid any disruptions.</p>

<p>As part of this maintenance, the operating system on Grace has been upgraded to Red Hat 8.  A new unified software tree that is shared with the McCleary cluster has been created.</p>
<p>The ssh host keys for Grace's login nodes were changed during the maintenance, which will result in a "WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!" error when you attempt to login. To access the cluster again, first remove the old host keys with the following command (if accessing the cluster via command line):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>ssh-keygen -R grace.hpc.yale.edu
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you are using a GUI, such as MobaXterm, you will need to manually edit your known host file and remove the list related to Grace.
For MobaXterm, this file is located (by default) in <code>Documents/MobaXterm/home/.ssh</code>.</p>
<p>Then attempt a new login and accept the new host key.</p>

<p>On the occasion of decommissioning the Ruddle cluster on July 24, the Yale Center for Genome Analysis (YCGA) and the Yale Center for Research Computing (YCRC) would like to acknowledge the profound impact Ruddle has had on computing at Yale. Ruddle provided the compute resources for YCGA's high throughput sequencing and supported genomic computing for hundreds of research groups at YSM and across the University. In February 2016, Ruddle replaced the previous biomedical cluster BulldogN. Since then, it has run more than 24 million user jobs comprising more than 73 million compute hours.</p>
<p>Funding for Ruddle came from NIH grant 1S10OD018521-01, with Shrikant Mane as PI. Ruddle is replaced by a dedicated partition and storage on the new McCleary cluster, which were funded by NIH grant 1S10OD030363-01A1, also awarded to Dr. Mane.</p>

<h4 id="mccleary-officially-launches">McCleary Officially Launches</h4>
<p>Today marks the official beginning of the McCleary cluster’s service. In addition to compute nodes migrated from Farnam and Ruddle, McCleary features our first set of direct-to-chip liquid cooled (DLC) nodes, moving YCRC into a more environmentally friendly future. McCleary is significantly larger than the Farnam and Ruddle clusters combined. The new DLC compute nodes are able to run faster and with higher CPU density due to their superior cooling system.</p>
<p>McCleary is named for Beatrix McCleary Hamburg, who received her medical degree in 1948 and was the first female African American graduate of Yale School of Medicine. </p>
<h4 id="farnam-farewell-june-1-2023">Farnam Farewell: June 1, 2023</h4>
<p>On the occasion of decommissioning the Farnam cluster on June 1, YCRC would like to acknowledge the profound impact Farnam has had on computing at Yale. Farnam supported biomedical computing at YSM and across the University providing compute resources to hundreds of research groups. Farnam replaced the previous biomedical cluster Louise, and began production in October 2016. Since then, it has run user jobs comprising more than 139 million compute hours. Farnam is replaced by the new cluster McCleary. </p>
<p>Please note: Read-only access to Farnam’s storage system (/gpfs/ysm) will be available on McCleary until July 13, 2023. For more information see <a href="/data/mccleary-transfer/">McCleary transfer documentation</a>.</p>

Logins will be disabled June 1, 2023, which will mark the official end of Farnam’s service. Read-only access to Farnam’s storage system (/gpfs/ysm) will be available on McCleary until July 13, 2023. All data on YSM (that you want to keep) will need to be transferred off YSM, either to non-HPC storage or to McCleary project space by you prior to YSM’s retirement.</p>
<h4 id="ruddle-decommission-july-1-2023">Ruddle Decommission: July 1, 2023</h4>
<p>After many years of serving YCGA, the Ruddle cluster will also be decommissioned this summer as we transition to the newly deployed McCleary cluster. Logins will be disabled July 1, 2023, which will mark the official end of Ruddle’s service. We will be migrating project and sequencing directories from Ruddle to McCleary. However, you are responsible for moving home and scratch data to McCleary before July 1, 2023.  </p>
<p>Please begin to migrate your data and workloads to McCleary at your earliest convenience and <a href="/">reach out</a> with any questions.</p>
<h3 id="mccleary-transition-reminder">McCleary Transition Reminder</h3>
<p>With our McCleary cluster now in a production stable state, we ask all Farnam users to ensure all home, project and scratch data the group wishes to keep is migrated to the new cluster ahead of the June 1st decommission. As June 1st is the formal retirement of Farnam, compute service charges on McCleary commons partitions will begin at this time. Ruddle users will have until July 1st to access the Ruddle and migrate their home and scratch data as needed. Ruddle users will NOT need to migrate their project directories; those will be automatically transferred to McCleary. As previously established on Ruddle, all jobs in the YCGA partitions will be exempt from compute service charges on the new cluster. For more information visit <a href="https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters/mccleary-farnam-ruddle/">our McCleary Transition documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The biannual scheduled maintenance for the Grace cluster will be occurring December 6-8. During this time, the cluster will be unavailable. Additionally, the Gibbs filesystem will be unavailable on Farnam and Ruddle on Tuesday, December 6th to deploy a critical firmware upgrade. See the maintenance email announcements for more details.</p>
<h4 id="loomis-decommission">Loomis Decommission</h4>
<p>The Loomis GPFS filesystem will be retired and unmounted from Grace and Farnam during the Grace December maintenance starting on December 6th. All data except for a few remaining private filesets have already been transferred to other systems (e.g., current software, home, scratch to Palmer and project to Gibbs). The remaining private filesets are being transferred to Gibbs in advance of the maintenance and owners should have received communications accordingly. The only potential user impact of the retirement is on anyone using the older, deprecated software trees. Otherwise, the Loomis retirement should have no user impact but please reach out if you have any concerns or believe you are still using data located on Loomis. <a href="/data/loomis-decommission/">See the Loomis Decommission documentation for more information.</a> </p>
<h4 id="apptainer-upgrade-on-grace-and-ruddle">Apptainer Upgrade on Grace and Ruddle</h4>
<p>The newest version of Apptainer (v1.1, available now on Ruddle and, after December maintenance, on Grace) comes the ability to create containers without needing elevated privileges (i.e. <code>sudo</code> access). This greatly simplifies the container workflow as you no longer need a separate system to build a container from a definition file. You can simply create a definition file and run the build command. </p>
<p>For example, to create a simple toy container from this def file (<code>lolcow.def</code>):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>BootStrap: docker
From: ubuntu:20.04

%post
    apt-get -y update
    apt-get -y install cowsay lolcat

%environment
    export LC_ALL=C
    export PATH=/usr/games:$PATH

%runscript
    date | cowsay | lolcat
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>salloc -p interactive -c 4 
apptainer build lolcow.sif lolcow.def
</code></pre></div>
<p>This upgrade is live on Ruddle and will be applied on Grace during the December maintenance.

<h4 id="ruddle-maintenance">Ruddle Maintenance</h4>
<p>The biannual scheduled maintenance for the Ruddle cluster will be occurring Nov 1-3. During this time, the cluster will be unavailable. See the Ruddle maintenance email announcements for more details.</p>
<h4 id="grace-and-milgram-maintenance-schedule-change">Grace and Milgram Maintenance Schedule Change</h4>
<p>We will be adjusting the timing of Grace and Milgram's scheduled maintenance periods. Starting this December, Grace's maintenance periods will occur in December and June, with the next scheduled for December 6-8, 2022. Milgram's next maintenance will instead be performed in February and August, with the next scheduled for February 7-9, 2023. Please refer to previously sent communications for more information and see the full maintenance schedule for next year on our status page.</p>
<h4 id="requeue-after-timeout">Requeue after Timeout</h4>
<p>The YCRC clusters all have maximum time-limits that sometimes are shorter than a job needs to finish. This can be a frustration for researchers trying to get a simulation or a project finished. However, a number of workflows have the ability to periodically save the status of a process to a file and restart from where it left off. This is often referred to as "checkpointing" and is built into many standard software tools, like Gaussian and Gromacs. </p>
<p>Slurm is able to send a signal to your job just before it runs out of time. Upon receiving this signal, you can have your job save its current status and automatically submit a new version of the job which picks up where it left off.  Here is an example of a simple script that resubmits a job after receiving the <code>TIMEOUT</code> signal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p day
#SBATCH -t 24:00:00
#SBATCH -c 1
#SBATCH --signal=B:10@30 # send the signal `10` at 30s before job finishes
#SBATCH --requeue        # mark this job eligible for requeueing

# define a `trap` that catches the signal and requeues the job
trap &quot;echo -n &#39;TIMEOUT @ &#39;; date; echo &#39;Resubmitting...&#39;; scontrol requeue ${SLURM_JOBID}  &quot; 10

# run the main code, with the `&amp;` to “background” the task
./my_code.exe &amp;

# wait for either the main code to finish to receive the signal
wait
</code></pre></div>
<p>This tells Slurm to send <code>SIGNAL10</code> at ~30s before the job finishes. Then we define an action (or <code>trap</code>) based on this signal which requeues the job. Don’t forget to add the <code>&amp;</code> to the end of the main executable and the <code>wait</code> command so that the trap is able to catch the signal. </p>

<h4 id="farnam-maintenance">Farnam Maintenance</h4>
<p>The biannual scheduled maintenance for the Farnam cluster will be occurring Oct 4-6. During this time, the cluster will be unavailable. See the Farnam maintenance email announcements for more details.</p>
<h4 id="gibbs-maintenance">Gibbs Maintenance</h4>
<p>Additionally, the Gibbs storage system will be unavailable on Grace and Ruddle on Oct 4 to deploy an urgent firmware fix. All jobs on those clusters will be held, and no new jobs will be able to start during the upgrade to avoid job failures.</p>
<h4 id="new-command-for-interactive-jobs">New Command for Interactive Jobs</h4>
<p>The new version of Slurm (the scheduler) has improved the process of launching an interactive compute job. Instead of the clunky <code>srun --pty bash</code> syntax from previous versions, this is now replaced with <code>salloc</code>. In addition, the interactive partition is now the default partition for jobs launched using <code>salloc</code>. Thus a simple (1 core, 1 hour) interactive job can be requested like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>salloc
</code></pre></div>
<p>which will submit the job and then move your shell to the allocated compute node. </p>
<p>For MPI users, this allows multi-node parallel jobs to be properly launched inside an interactive compute job, which did not work as expected previously. For example, here is a two-node job, launched with <code>salloc</code> and then a parallel job-step launched with <code>srun</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>[user@grace1 ~]$ salloc --nodes 2 --ntasks 2 --cpus-per-task 1
salloc: Nodes p09r07n[24,28] are ready for job

[user@p09r07n24 ~]$ srun hostname
p09r07n24.grace.hpc.yale.internal
P09r07n28.grace.hpc.yale.internal
</code></pre></div>
<p>For more information on <code>salloc</code>, please refer to <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/salloc.html">Slurm’s documentation</a>.</p>

<h4 id="software-module-extensions">Software Module Extensions</h4>
<p>Our software module utility (<a href="https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Lmod</a>) has been enhanced to enable searching for Python and R (among other software) extensions. This is a very helpful way to know which software modules contain a specific library or package. For example, to see what versions of <code>ggplot2</code> are available, use the <code>module spider</code> command. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ module spider ggplot2
--------------------------------------------------------
  ggplot2:
--------------------------------------------------------
     Versions:
        ggplot2/3.3.2 (E)
        ggplot2/3.3.3 (E)
        ggplot2/3.3.5 (E)
</code></pre></div>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ module spider ggplot2/3.3.5
-----------------------------------------------------------
  ggplot2: ggplot2/3.3.5 (E)
-----------------------------------------------------------
    This extension is provided by the following modules. To access the extension you must load one of the following modules. Note that any module names in parentheses show the module location in the software hierarchy.

       R/4.2.0-foss-2020b
</code></pre></div>
<p>This indicates that by loading the <code>R/4.2.0-foss-2020b</code> module you will gain access to <code>ggplot2/3.3.5</code>. </p>

<h3 id="loomis-decommission-and-project-data-migration">Loomis Decommission and Project Data Migration</h3>
<p>After over eight years in service, the primary storage system on Grace, Loomis (<code>/gpfs/loomis</code>), will be retired later this year.</p>
<p><strong>Project.</strong> We have migrated all of the Loomis project space (<code>/gpfs/loomis/project</code>) to the Gibbs storage system at <code>/gpfs/gibbs/project</code> during the maintenance. You will need to update your scripts and workflows to point to the new location (<code>/gpfs/gibbs/project/&lt;group&gt;/&lt;netid&gt;</code>). The "project" symlink in your home directory has been updated to point to your new space (with a few exceptions described below), so scripts using the symlinked path will not need to be updated. If you have jobs in a pending state going into the maintenance that used the absolute Loomis path, we recommend canceling, updating and then re-submitting those jobs so they do not fail.</p>
<p>If you had a project space that exceeds the no-cost allocation (4 TiB), you have received a separate communication from us with details about your data migration. In these instances, your group has been granted a new, empty "project" space with the default no-cost quota. Any scripts will need to be updated accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Conda.</strong>  By default, all conda environments are installed into your project directory. However, most conda environments do not survive being moved from one location to another, so you may need to regenerate your conda environment(s). To assist with this, we provide <a href="/clusters-at-yale/guides/conda-export/">conda-export documentation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>R.</strong>  Similarly, in 2022 we started redirecting user R packages to your project space to conserve home directory usage. If your R environment is not working as expected, we recommend deleting the old installation (found in <code>~/project/R/&lt;version&gt;</code>) and rerunning install.packages.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Software Installation.</strong> If you or your group had any self-installed software in the project directory, it is possible that the migration will have broken the software and it will need to be recompiled. <a href="/#get-help">Contact us</a> if you need assistance recompiling.</p>
<p><strong>Scratch60.</strong> The Loomis scratch space (<code>/gpfs/loomis/scratch60</code>) is now read-only. All data  in that directory will be purged in 60 days on <strong>October 3, 2022</strong>. Any data in <code>/gpfs/loomis/scratch60</code> you wish to retain needs to be copied into another location by that date (such as your Gibbs project or Palmer scratch).</p>
<h3 id="changes-to-non-interactive-sessions">Changes to Non-Interactive Sessions</h3>
<p>Non-interactive sessions (e.g. file transfers, commands sent over ssh) no longer load the standard cluster environment to alleviate performance issues due to unnecessary module loads. Please contact us if this change affects your workflow so we can resolve the issue or provide a workaround.</p>

<p>The biannual scheduled maintenance for the Grace cluster will be occurring August 2-4. During this time, the cluster will be unavailable. See the Grace maintenance email announcement for more details.</p>
<p>During the maintenance, significant changes will be made to the project and scratch60 directories on Grace. See <a href="https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/data/loomis-decommission/">our website for more information and updates</a>.</p>
<h4 id="spinup-researcher-image-containers">SpinUp Researcher Image &amp; Containers</h4>
<p>Yale offers a simple portal for creating cloud-based compute resources called <a href="https://spinup.yalepages.org">SpinUp</a>. These cloud instances are hosted on Amazon Web Services, but have access to Yale services like Active Directory, DNS, and Storage at Yale. SpinUp offers a range of services including virtual machines, web servers, remote storage, and databases. </p>
<p>Part of this service is a Researcher Image, an Ubuntu-based system which contains a suite of pre-installed commonly utilized software utilities, including:
- PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, and other GPU-accelerated deep learning frameworks
- GCC, Cmake, Go, and other development tools
- Singularity/Apptainer and Docker for container development</p>
<p>We recommend researchers looking to develop containers for use on YCRC HPC resources to utilize SpinUp to build containers which can then be copied to the clusters. </p>
<p>If there are software utilities or commonly used tools that you would like added to the Researcher Image, let us know and we can work with the Cloud Team to get them integrated.</p>

Instructions on how to use VirtualGL to accelerate your 3D applications can be found at <a href="https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/guides/virtualgl/">https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/guides/virtualgl/</a>. </p>
<h3 id="software-highlights">Software Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Singularity is now called "Apptainer".</strong> Singularity is officially named “Apptainer” as part of its move to the Linux Foundation. The new command <code>apptainer</code> works as drop-in replacement for <code>singularity</code>. However, the previous <code>singularity</code> command will also continue to work for the foreseeable future so no change is needed. The upgrade to Apptainer is on Grace, Farnam and Ruddle (as of the maintenance completion). Milgram will be upgraded to Apptainer during the June maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Slurm</strong> has been upgraded to version 21.08.6 on Grace</li>
<li><strong>MATLAB/2022a</strong> is available on all clusters</li>

<h4 id="updates-to-r-on-open-ondemand">Updates to R on Open OnDemand</h4>
<p>RStudio Server is out of beta! With the deprecation of R 3.x (see below), we will be removing RStudio Desktop with module R from Open OnDemand on June 1st.</p>
<h4 id="improvements-to-r-installpackages-paths">Improvements to R install.packages Paths</h4>
<p>Starting with the R 4.1.0 software module, we now automatically set an environment variable (<code>R_LIBS_USER</code>) which directs these packages to be stored in your project space. This will helps ensure that packages are not limited by home-space quotas and that packages installed for different versions of R are properly separated from each other. Previously installed packages should still be available and there should be no disruption from the change.</p>
<h4 id="instructions-for-running-a-mysql-server-on-the-clusters">Instructions for Running a MySQL Server on the Clusters</h4>
<p>Occasionally it could be useful for a user to run their own MySQL database server on one of the clusters.  Until now, that has not been possible, but recently we found a way using singularity.  Instructions may be found in our <a href="/clusters-at-yale/guides/mysql/">new MySQL guide</a>.</p>
<h3 id="software-highlights">Software Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>R 3.x modules have been deprecated</strong> on all clusters and are no longer supported. If you need to continue to use an older version of R, look at our <a href="https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/guides/r/#conda-based-r-environments">R conda documentation</a>.</li>
<li><strong>R/4.1.0-foss-2020b</strong> is now available on all clusters.</li>
<li><strong>Seurat/4.1.0-foss-2020b-R-4.1.0</strong> (for using the Seurat R package) is now available on all clusters.</li>

<ul>
<li>Latest security patches applied</li>
<li>Slurm updated to version 21.08.5</li>
<li>NVIDIA driver updated to version 510.39.01 (except for nodes with K80 GPUs which are stranded at 470.82.01)</li>
<li>Singularity updated to version 3.8.5</li>
<li>Open OnDemand updated to version 2.0.20</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hardware-updates">Hardware Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Changes have been made to networking to improve performance of certain older compute nodes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changes-to-grace-home-directories">Changes to Grace Home Directories</h3>
<p>During the maintenance, all home directories on Grace have been moved to our new all-flash storage filesystem, Palmer. The move is in anticipation of the decommissioning of Loomis at the end of the year and will provide a robust login experience by protecting home directory interactions from data intensive compute jobs.</p>
<p>Due to this migration, your home directory path has changed from <code>/gpfs/loomis/home.grace/&lt;netid&gt;</code> to <code>/vast/palmer/home.grace/&lt;netid&gt;</code>.
Your home directory can always be referenced in bash and submission scripts and from the command line with the <code>$HOME</code> variable. Please update any scripts and workflows accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="interactive-jobs">Interactive Jobs</h3>
<p>We have added an additional way to request an interactive job. The Slurm command <code>salloc</code> can be used to start an interactive job similar to <code>srun --pty bash</code>. In addition to being a simpler command (no <code>--pty bash</code> is needed), <code>salloc</code> jobs can be used to interactively test <code>mpirun</code> executables.</p>
<h3 id="palmer-scratch">Palmer scratch</h3>
<p>Palmer is out of beta! We have fixed the issue with Plink on Palmer, so now you can use Palmer scratch for any workloads. See <a href="/data/hpc-storage/#60-day-scratch">https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/data/hpc-storage#60-day-scratch</a> for more information on Palmer scratch. </p>

<h4 id="grace-maintenance">Grace Maintenance</h4>
<p>The biannual scheduled maintenance for the Grace cluster will be occurring February 1-3. During this time, the cluster will be unavailable. See the Grace maintenance email announcement for more details.</p>
<h4 id="data-transfers">Data Transfers</h4>
<p>For non-Milgram users doing data transfers, transfers should not be performed on the login nodes. We have a few alternative ways to get better networking and reduce the impact on the clusters’ login nodes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dedicated transfer node</strong>. Each cluster has a dedicated transfer node, <code>transfer-&lt;cluster&gt;.hpc.yale.edu</code>. You can ssh directly to this node and run commands. </li>
<li><strong>“transfer” Slurm partition</strong>. This is a small partition managed by the scheduler for doing data transfer. You can submit jobs to it using <code>srun/sbatch -p transfer …</code> 
*For recurring or periodic data transfers (such as using cron), please use Slurm’s <a href="https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/job-scheduling/scrontab/">scrontab</a> to schedule jobs that run on the transfer partition instead.</li>
<li><strong>Globus</strong>. For robust transfers of larger amount of data, see our <a href="https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/data/globus/">Globus</a> documentation.</li>
</ol>
<p>More info about data transfers can be found in our <a href="https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/data/transfer/">Data Transfer</a> documentation.</p>
