# YCRC User Group

The YCRC User Group is a community of researchers at Yale who utilize computing resources and technology to enable their research. The User Group holds monthly meetings, each on a distinct topic of interest to the community. During meeting there are opportunities for members of the research community to teach and learn from their peers in a mix of panel discussions, presentations, lightning talks, working groups and informal discussions.

User Group meetings are held monthly in the YCRC Auditorium on the 
second Wednesday of each month at 4:00 pm.

You can join the User Group mailing list and forum at [https://groups.io/g/ycrcusergroup](https://groups.io/g/ycrcusergroup).
