### Announcements

#### Globus Available on Milgram

Globus is now available to move data in and out from Milgram. For increased security, Globus only has access to a staging directory (`/gpfs/milgram/globus/$NETID`) where you can temporarily store data. Please see [our documentation page](https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/data/globus/) for more information and reach out to [research.computing@yale.edu](mailto:research.computing@yale.edu) if you have any questions.

#### RStudio Server Updates

RStudio Server on the OpenDemand web portal for all clusters now starts an R session in a clean environment and will not save the session when you finish. If you want to save your session and reuse it next time, please select the checkbox "Start R from your last saved session".
