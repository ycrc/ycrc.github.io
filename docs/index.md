!!! attention "COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 Research"
    If you're doing computational research related to COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 on an HPC cluster and experience any long wait times for jobs to run, [please let us know](mailto:hpc@yale.edu).

# Introduction

The Yale Center for Research Computing provides support for research computing at Yale University. Our most active area for support is High Performance Computing, however we also support other computational intensive research such as Geo-Spatial Computation and Data Visualization.  In addition, we work with faculty and research groups across disciplines to design and maintain cost-effective computing capabilities.

## Get Help

To best serve the research community, we provide one-on-one consulting and use a support tracking system.

!!! info "Troubleshooting Login Issues"
    If you are experiencing issues logging into one of the clusters, please first check the current [System Status](http://research.computing.yale.edu/system-status) for known issues and check the [Troubleshoot Login guide](/clusters-at-yale/troubleshoot) first before seeking additional assistance.

### Web and Email Support

To submit requests, issues, or questions please send us an email at [hpc@yale.edu](mailto:hpc@yale.edu) or sign on to our online support system at [help.ycrc.yale.edu](https://help.ycrc.yale.edu). Your login credentials there are your email and a password of your choosing, not your CAS password.

Once received, our system will send an automated response with a link to a ticket. From there we'll track your ticket and make sure it's handled properly by the right person. Replies via email or the online support system go to the same place and are interchangeable. Constructive feedback is much appreciated.

### In Person Support

!!! question "Zoom Office Hours"
    Consistent with University guidance in response to COVID-19, <strong>one-on-one consulting and office hours are held remotely via Zoom</strong>.

    Research support team members are online during regular business hours (Monday - Friday, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm). We ask that you email us at [research.computing@yale.edu](mailto:research.computing@yale.edu) with details about your request and one of us will reach out to you.

### Q&A Platform

The YCRC recently joined a Q&A platform at [ask.cyberinfrastructure.org](http://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org). Feel free to post questions about the clusters there and receive answers from YCRC staff or even your peers! The sub-site for YCRC related questions is available at [ask.cyberinfrastructure.org/c/yale](http://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org/c/yale).
