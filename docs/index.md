!!! warning "NIH Controlled-Access Data and Repositories"
    Effective January 25, 2025, new or renewed Data Use Certifications for NIH Controlled-Access Data and Repositories must adhere to the [NIH Security Best Practices for Users of Controlled-Access Data](https://sharing.nih.gov/sites/default/files/flmngr/NIH-Security-BPs-for-Users-of-Controlled-Access-Data.pdf). This data can be now hosted and analyzed on YCRC's new NIST 800-171 compliant Hopper cluster. See the [Hopper documentation](/clusters/hopper) for information on requesting access.


!!! tip "The Bouchet Cluster is Now Available"
    The Bouchet HPC cluster is now available for all Yale researchers. Bouchet contains approximately 10,000 direct-liquid-cooled cores as well as 80 NVIDIA H200 GPUs and 48 NVIDIA RTX 5000 Ada GPUs. See the [Bouchet page](/clusters/bouchet) for more information.


## Acknowledge the YCRC

If publishing work performed on a YCRC cluster or with assistance from YCRC staff, we greatly appreciate 
acknowledgement of our staff and computing time in your publication. A list of YCRC staff can be found on our 
[Staff page](https://research.computing.yale.edu/about-us/meet-the-team), and the clusters are summarized on our

Additionally, if you would be willing to send the publication information to [research.computing@yale.edu](mailto:research.computing@yale.edu), that would assist our efforts to capture work performed on YCRC resources and we can promote your work on our [research.computing.yale.edu](https://research.computing.yale.edu) website.

# Introduction

The Yale Center for Research Computing provides support for research computing at Yale University. Our most active area for support is High Performance Computing, however we also support other computationally intensive research.  In addition, we work with faculty and research groups across disciplines to design and maintain cost-effective computing capabilities.

## Get Help

To best serve the research community, we provide one-on-one consulting and use a support tracking system.

!!! info "Troubleshooting Login Issues"
    If you are experiencing issues logging into one of the clusters, please first check the current [System Status](http://research.computing.yale.edu/system-status) for known issues and check the [Troubleshoot Login guide](/clusters-at-yale/troubleshoot) first before seeking additional assistance.

### YouTube Channel

The [YCRC YouTube channel](https://ycrc.yale.edu/youtube) features recorded tutorials and workshops that cover a wide range of computing topics.
New videos are added regularly and suggestions for topics can be submitted by emailing [research.computing@yale.edu](mailto:research.computing@yale.edu).

### Web and Email Support

To submit requests, issues, or questions and receive a response within 24 hours, please send us an email at [hpc@yale.edu](mailto:hpc@yale.edu) or you can sign on to our online support system at [help.ycrc.yale.edu](https://help.ycrc.yale.edu). Your login credentials there are your email and a password of your choosing, not your CAS password.

[Submit Help Request](mailto:hpc@yale.edu){ .md-button }

Once received, our system will send an automated response with a link to a ticket. From there we'll track your ticket and respond within 24 hours, and make sure it's handled properly by the right person. Replies via email or the online support system go to the same place and are interchangeable. Constructive feedback is much appreciated.

### One-on-One Support

Research support team members are available by appointment for one-on-one zoom support.  See the table below for information about each person's area of particular focus.
Please send requests for appointments with a team member to [research.computing@yale.edu](mailto:research.computing@yale.edu).  If you have a general question or are unsure about who to meet with, 
include as much detail as possible about your request and we'll find the right person for you. Meeting requests will usually be fulfilled within 1-5 working days depending on schedules.

### Office Hours via Zoom

The YCRC hosts weekly office hours via Zoom on **Wednesdays at 11am-12pm EST and Thursdays at 2pm-3pm EST**. Every Wednesday and Thursday, Research Support Team Members will be available to answer questions about the HPC clusters, data storage, cluster usage, etc. No appointments are necessary. Each participant will be allotted 15 minutes to discuss their issues/questions with more time potentially available in cases where there is not a large queue. If it is more than 24 hours until Office Hours, there will likely be a faster response/solution to your issue via ticket submission to research.computing@yale.edu. For 15 minute consultations, some examples of appropriate office hour topics include:

- general questions about YCRC systems such as partitions, access, resources, etc.
- novice user questions
- OOD related issues
- project discussions about resource needs
- resource monitoring/management 
- errors related to missing libraries in R/Python/etc.

some topics that will likely take longer than 15 minutes include:

- program/module installations
- code troubleshooting
- miniconda environment creations

If a Research Support Team Member considers the issue to require longer than the alloted 15 minutes, then you may be 
requested to create a ticket describing the issue by emailing research.computing@yale.edu. At which point, you will be 
assigned the appropriate team member to address your issue and receive a response within 24 hours.

### Q&A Platform

The YCRC hosts a Q&A platform at [ask.cyberinfrastructure.org](http://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org). Post questions about the clusters and receive answers from YCRC staff or even your peers! The sub-site for YCRC related questions is available at [ask.cyberinfrastructure.org/g/Yale](https://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org/g/Yale).
